# Role of Governance in the StegVerse Stack

## Purpose

Governance exists to **evaluate verified facts** and emit **decisions or recommendations**.
It does NOT create identity, verify cryptography, or rewrite history.

Governance is downstream of StegID.

---

## What Governance IS

Governance MAY:

- Evaluate verified Continuity Receipts
- Apply human-readable and machine-enforceable policies
- Emit decisions, recommendations, or denials
- Produce auditable decision records
- Gate downstream actions (StegOps, StegTV, StegTalk, etc.)

Governance decisions are **contextual**, **versioned**, and **revisable**.

---

## What Governance IS NOT

Governance MUST NOT:

- Mint or alter identity
- Create or modify Continuity Receipts
- Override cryptographic verification results
- Assert truth without reference to verified inputs
- Act without producing an auditable record

---

## Relationship to StegID

StegID answers:
> “What happened, and can it be proven?”

Governance answers:
> “Given verified facts, what should happen next?”

This separation is intentional and non-negotiable.

---

## Design Principle

> Governance has authority over **decisions**, not **truth**.
